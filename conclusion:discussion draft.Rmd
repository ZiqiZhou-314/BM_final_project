## Conclusion/Discussion

Gender is an important factor which contributes to the salaries of faculties with coefficient 0.074 and p-value 0.007 in the final model. Therefore, we conclude that the data support the claim of gender discrimination in setting salaries. Moreover, department, clinical or research emphasis, board certified or not and years of experience confound the association between salaries and gender. It's important to note that rank interacts with gender in contributing to the salaries, meaning that rank relieves the effect measure of the association between salaries and gender.

We determined No.184 as an influential point by checking the standardized residuals. This is a male assistant professor in the department of medicine, with primarily research emphasis, not certified, 5.1 publication rate, and with 2 years experience since obtaining MD. With rather low experience and publicartion rate, this sample male assistant professor gets very high salary. It might be because of gender or there are other factors not included in the dataset.
