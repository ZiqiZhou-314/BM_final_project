## Conclusion/Discussion

Based on the data set, gender demonstrates no association with salary from 1994 and 1995 after adjusting for department affliation, clinical emphasis, board certification status, rank, and experience. Therefore, we conclude that the data does not support the claim of gender discrimination in setting salaries at Houston College of Medicine. Moreover, department, clinical or research emphasis, board certified or not and years of experience confound the association between salaries and gender. It's important to note that rank interacts with gender in contributing to the salaries, meaning that rank relieves the effect measure of the association between salaries and gender.

Futhermore, it was determined that physician 184 is an influential point based on the standardized residuals. Physician 184 is a male uncertified assistant professor in the department of medicine, with a research emphasis, a 5.1 publication rate, and has 2 years experience since obtaining MD. With all things considered, physician 184 has an unusually high salary. This could be due to other factors that were not included in this data set such as the importance of research and publication this particular physician was involved in or the number of hours he works.
